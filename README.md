This Python project allows users to calculate and visualize key concepts from Portfolio Theory for a two-asset portfolio. It generates the **feasible set**, **efficient frontier**, **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)**, **Tangency (Market) Portfolio**, and the **Capital Market Line (CML)** based on user inputs for expected returns, volatilities, correlation, and the risk-free rate.

## Features
- Compute **portfolio expected return and volatility** for all combinations of two assets.  
- Identify the **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)**.  
- Identify the **Tangency Portfolio (Market Portfolio)** given a risk-free rate.  
- Visualize:
  - Feasible set of all portfolio combinations (short selling allowed)  
  - Efficient frontier  
  - Minimum Variance Portfolio and Tangency Portfolio  
  - Capital Market Line (CML)  
  - Individual assets
